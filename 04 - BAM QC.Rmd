```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

This is a chance to run some of the read-level QC tools & view their outputs:

1 - Picard RNASeqMetrics 
2 - RNASEQC
* Coverage Plots
* GC Content plot

```{r}
# TODO Add Dockers/Apps for these analyses. This will likely take a reasonable amount of energy.  Picard is a cloud app, 
# but ERCC Dashboard and RNASEQC are not.  Dashboard scripts can either be run via dockers
# or done locally.  RNASEQC has an API available on the broad's "genepattern" cloud.

```
