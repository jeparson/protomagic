```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)#have to cache for some of this DE to be iteratively useful.
```

Now to calculate differential expression.

We need to subselect various replicates of each type of sample.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Some code to select samples simply
choosesamples<-function(types){
  #picks out the samples of the chosen types:
  #loads the experimental design document off of cloud [[this doesn't exist yet]]
  experimentaldesignfile="url.to.file"
    expdesign<-read.table(experimentaldesignfile,sep="\t")#maybe needs to be a get call.
  
  
  
}

```
We then need to do DE testing of various pairwise comparisons.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
DEdata<-DESeq2::DESeqDataSet(countData = mastercounts,colData=colnames(expdesign),design = tabletodeseq(expdesign))

tabletodeseq<-function(table){
  #convert the tabular design of the experimental design file into an experimental design that DESeq understands...
}

```
