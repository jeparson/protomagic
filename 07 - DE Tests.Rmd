```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Now to calculate Differential expression.

We need to subselect various replicates of each type of sample.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Some code to select samples simply
choosesamples<-function(types){
  #picks out the samples of the chosen types:
  #loads the experimental design document off of cloud [[this doesn't exist yet]]
  experimentaldesignfile="url.to.file"
    expdesign<-read.table(experimentaldesignfile,sep="\t")
  
  
  
}

```
